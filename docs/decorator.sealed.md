**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

This method is ment to be used as decorator, When this function is executed, it will seal both the constructor and its prototype which would not allow the class to be sub-classed at runtime, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. Values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable.

## Example


```typescript
\@sealed
class BugReport {
  title: string;

  constructor(t: string) {
    this.title = t
  }
}
```
